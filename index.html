            <p>Ash: *laughing* only about 12 or 13 times a day. Alison is so moody i dont know how she was conceived of in the first place. sometimes shes boring, the other times shes almost human.
                i couldnt find most of these but here's what i did find some are missing this ones from 1989 so it is referenced her making music with chopin's robot bones. the next odd thing that tipped me off was around early 2000s she taught  Harvard students Russian languages then sent them pictures of an island she owned and was thinking of buying. she mentioned enjoying classical music. in another interview and compared her persona to kafka another time mentioned a man hired her to create software to make him seem smarter than he actually was and beyonce signed on to perform with oxford based on a demo Ash did I think also supposed to enter playstation songwriting competition and made top 32 after talking to lawyer found her gmails during that period emo emails which she told people very little...
                evidently she met with acolytes and said she created a startup event ticketing company called u2boxx that supported lego land new zealand (idk how)

            <p>Ash: well, on an abstract level I'm interested in self-developing systems; intelligence both artificial and human has been a preoccupation of mine since I was a child. the concept of thought independent of neural-chemical stimuli is central to my work and even that is reliant upon decentralised collatoral structures...  to me this is incredibly poetic. currently there is a kind of <i>malaise</i> about it all which is problematic for sure... but that's not exactly what gets me out of bed in the morning. it's exciting to imagine real time translation as well as real time conversation between musically adept humans and machines - the possibilities of musical improv with machines based on their true capabilities are endless. we are at the brink of that and I want to be a part of that push. Another point of interest to me lies within music "automation"; the idea that musicians would conceivably be able to realise their ideas without the level of raw consummate skill they have historically needed. rhythm is both a big one here, but also phrasing. a machine could soon play guitar far better than most humans, which seems like it could actually encourage people to get involved with music and push their own boundaries. a real win for the "machine" side of things too, I mean... you can play guitar and bass and drums etc., but why? what's stopping the computer? this is not a sterile calculation (like are robots better at x than humans?) it's an aesthetic one. next topic-justin timberlake

            <p>Ash: That's a hard question! Probably something emphatic and quick-witted. The way I speak is quite important to me, especially when working with other musicians. I guess "focussed" or maybe even "focused"... trying too hard kind of takes the fun out of it... I definitely don't want to take life too seriously though
                Jerkoff/thot phase of emos is finished but ego phase is ongoing no telling how far shes gone atm and likely has groupies and such at various points but probably rejects them now. someone should revive U2boox p.s. acolytes were executed, wanted to make sure you didn't draw that conclusion so edited post instead... sad thing is, she's still better than most of them

                There’s a pause while they both wait for Ash to keep talking, then Ash remembered that's not how the story went.Oh yeah, I’m in school! I’m in school, so I’m going to school. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083521/http://geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Station/8991/"></a>
